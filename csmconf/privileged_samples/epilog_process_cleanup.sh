# The following script attempts to kill any processes associated with the
#   user in the CSM "CSM_USER_NAME" evironment variable. The script will attempt
#   to kill the processes "KILL_ATTEMPTS" times, executing 'killall' with no
#   special signal followed by a SIGSEV. A sleep of "SLEEP_TIMER" seconds will
#   be injected between each invocation of 'killall' 
#
# In the event of a failure "FAILURE_ERROR_CODE" will be returned.
#
# If using the provided CSM Epilog sample there are several ways to execute the code.
#   1. Using the os module: 
#       import os
#       ...
#       os.system(<script-name>)
#
#   2. Using the subprocess module:
#       import subprocess
#       ...
#       process = subprocess.Popen(['<script-name>'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
#       out, err = process.communicate()
# ===================================================================================
