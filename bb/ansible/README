This describes how to use ansible to update burst buffer with or without csm
on compute nodes, bbserver nodes, launch nodes, and management nodes. 

Here is an example helper script for running the update.yml playbook:

#!/bin/bash 
export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY_CACHE_PLUGIN=jsonfile
export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY_CACHE=True
#default forks is 5, override
FORKS=50
FQPATH=$(readlink -fm $0)
echo $FQPATH
PLAYDIR=$(dirname $FQPATH)
echo $PLAYDIR
cd $PLAYDIR
sudo ansible-playbook -i hosts  update.yml -f $FORKS


Running update.sh will run the update.yml playbook.  The bash script will
switch to the directory of update.sh and use the hosts inventory file residing
there.  The update playbook requires root.  The update.sh does a sudo.
The bash script also sets environment variables to speed along execution.

Execution of playbooks in the ansible directory requires switching to the
directory and executing ansible-playbook as root.
Example:
sudo ansible-playbook -i hosts update.yml

The ansible documentation also mentions ansible.cfg options and locations.
The playbook design presumes the configuration file of /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg.
