dcgm-diag: nvidia dcgm based diag test
   It requires an argument, that is the level of the diagnostic. Valid values are:
   1 - Quick System Validation (~ seconds)  
   2 - Extended System Validation (~ 2 minutes)  
   3 - System HW Diagnostics ( ~ 15 minutes)       

test_simple
   A very simple hello test, one file.
   If the test is not in a shared filesystem, the Framework should execute 
   without copying the file to remote node(s)
             xdsh -e

test_2
   A very simple test, but requires 2 files and an argument.
   If the test is not in a shared filesystem, the Framework will copy both 
   files to the remote node(s) and execute.
   The argument N is the input to the test_2.sh, a test that counts from 1 
   to N. If N is set to a higher number, the timeout should be adjusted.
