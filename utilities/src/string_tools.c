* Summary: This function takes in a string and counts the number of 'seperated values' based on a delimiter.
* Parameters:
*   char*   myString:   The string to parse through.
*   char    delimiter:  The delimiter to check for inside the string. (Example: ',' or ' ')
*   int*    dataCount:  A pointer to an int. When this function finishes, this will contain
*                       the number of 'seperated values' found in 'myString'.
* Returns: int 
*   0 Success
*   1 ERROR: Problem with code. Skipped dataCount check.
*   2 ERROR: dataCount is negative. Expected to be >= 0
*   3 ERROR: dataCount is 0. Expected to be != 0
*   4 ERROR: myString is NULL. Can not parse NULL string.
