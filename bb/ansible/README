This describes how to use ansible to check, uninstall, and install burstbuffer on 
compute nodes, bbserver nodes, launch nodes, and management nodes. 

Execution requires changing to the directory and running as root
Example:
sudo ansible-playbook -i hosts bbStop.ymls
sudo ansible-playbook -i hosts bbStart.yml

Logging is according the ansible.cfg in effect per ansible documentation.  This was run using /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg.
