CSM APIs
########

* The API ``csm_ib_cable_query`` has been updated to take on a search by filtering theme. It will now return all ib cables by default, and filter results based off of additional input the user provides. 
* UFM guids are now more uniformly represented across CSM. As a result some APIs were updated to 
  conform to these new standards.
* Some updates to UFM restAPIs caused CSM APIs to crash inbetween CSM 1.5.0 and CSM 1.6.0. These issues
  were resolved in CSM 1.5.x patch updates and are included in the main release of CSM 1.6.0.
* UFM updates required changes to CSM Database tables. As such, some changes to CSM APIs related to these
  tables needed to be updated and now require CSM DB 18.0 to function correctly.
