# This script checks the cpu, memory load or average load
# It returns 0 if the load <= threshold, 1 otherwise.
# parameters:
#    UNIT : cpu|mem|average, default is cpu
#    LOAD_THRESHOLD: threshold to be compared to. Default is 90. 
#           If unit is average, please read NOTE, below.
#    TOTAL_PROCESS: the number of process you want to be include in the check. Default is 1. 
#           If unit is average, this parameter is ignored       
#    list of process to exclude (cpu and mem only)

# NOTE:
# System load averages is the average number of processes that are either
# in a runnable or uninterruptable state.  A process  in a  runnable  state  
# is either using the CPU or waiting to use the CPU.  A process in uninterruptableS
# state is waiting for some I/O access, eg waiting for disk.  The averages are 
# taken over the three time intervals.  Load averages are not normalized  for
# the  number of CPUs in a system, so a load average of 1 means a single CPU system 
# is loaded all the time while on a 4 CPU system it means it was idle 75% of the time.
