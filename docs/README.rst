CAST Documentation
==================




Building the Documentation
--------------------------

CAST uses `Read the Docs`_ to distribute documentation, however for development builds the following
process should be followed to to build the documentation for CAST.

1. Install Sphinx with the ReadTheDocs theme:

    $ pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme recommonmark

2. Build the documentation:
    
    $ cd CAST/docs
    $ make html

A copy of the read the docs documentation should now have been built.
