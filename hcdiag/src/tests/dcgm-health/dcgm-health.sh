# Checks the overall health for the GPU subsystems (PCIe, SM, MCU, PMU, 
# Inforom, Power and thermal system)
# It consists of 3 steps:
# 1. Set the watches to be monitored.
# 2. Sleep 1 s
# 2. Check to see if any errors or warnings have occurred in the currently 
#      monitored watches.
# This script looks for lines with 'Error' below:
#    | Overall Health:   Healthy           |
#    | Overall Health:   Warning           |
#    | Overall Health:   Error             |
# Group monitoring is not supported

## These lines are mandatory, so the framework knows the name of the log file
## This is necessary when invoked standalone --with xcat-- and common_fs=yes
