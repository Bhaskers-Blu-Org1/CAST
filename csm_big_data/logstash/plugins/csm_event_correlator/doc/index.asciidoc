=== CSM Event Correlator Filter Plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

==== Description

Parses arbitrary text and structures the results of the parse into actionable events.

The CSM Event Correlator is a utility by which a system administrator may specify a collection
of patterns (grok style), grouping by context (e.g. syslog, event log, etc.), which trigger 
actions (ruby scripts).

CSM Event Correlator is compatible with all existing Logstash grok patterns default patterns
may be found in official Logstash documentation.

The CSM Event Correlator uses a yaml format to specify pattern-action pairs.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-grok_primer"]
==== Grok Primer

CSM Event Correlator uses grok to drive pattern matching. 

Grok is a regular expression pattern checking utility. A typical grok pattern has the following
syntax: `%{PATTERN_NAME:EXTRACTED_NAME}`

`PATTERN_NAME` is the name of a grok pattern specified in a pattern file or in the default Logstash
pattern space. Samples include `NUMBER`, `IP` and `WORD`. 

`EXTRACTED_NAME` is the identifier to be assigned to the text in the event context. The 
`EXTRACTED_NAME` will be accessible in the action through use of the `%{EXTRACTED_NAME}` pattern
as described later. `EXTRACTED_NAME` identifiers are added to the big data record in elasticsearch.
The `EXTRACTED_NAME` section is optional, patterns without the `EXTRACTED_NAME` are matched, but
not extracted.

For specifying custom patterns refer to 
<https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-patterns-core/tree/master/patterns>.

A grok pattern may also use raw regular expressions to perform non-extracting pattern matches.
_Anonymous_ extraction patterns may be specified with the following syntax: `(?<EXTRACTED_NAME>REGEX)`

`EXTRACTED_NAME` in the _anonymous_ extraction pattern is identical to the named pattern. `REGEX` is
a standard regular expression.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-action_programming"]
====  CSM Event Correlator Action Programming

Programming actions is a central part of the CSM Event Correlator. This plugin supports action scripting
using ruby. The action script supplied to the pipeline is converted to an anonymous function which
is invoked when the event is processed.

===== Default Variables

The action script has a number of variables which are acessible to action writers:
[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=============================================================================
| Variable     | Type            | Description
| event        | LogStash::Event | The event the action is generated for, getters provided.
| ras_msg_id   | string          | The ras message id, formatted.
| ras_location | string          | The location the RAS event originated from, parsed from event.
| ras_timestamp| string          | The timestamp to assign to the RAS event.
| raw_data     | string          | The raw data which generated the action.
|============================================================================

The user may directly influence any of these fields in their action script, however it is recommended
that the user take caution when manipulating the `event` as the contents of this field are ultimately
written to any Logstash targets. The `event` members may be accessed using the `%{field}` syntax.

The `ras_msg_id`, `ras_location`, `ras_timestamp`, and `raw_data` fields are used with the 
`.send_ras;` action keyword.

===== Accessing Event Fields

Event fields are commonly used to drive event actions. These fields may be specified by the 
event corelation rule or other Logstash plugins. Due to the importance of this pattern the 
CSM Event Correlator provides a special syntaxtic sugar for field access `%{FIELD_NAME}`.

This syntax is interpreted as `event.get(FIELD_NAME)` where the field name is a field in the 
event. If the field was not present the field will be interpreted as `nil`.

===== Action Keywords

Several action keywords are provided to abstract or reduce the code written in the actions. 
Action keywords always start with a `.` and end with a `;`.

|=============================================================================
| Keyword     | Postpends `;` | Description
| `.send_ras;`| Yes           | 
----
Creates a ras event with `msg_id` == `ras_msg_id`, `location_name` == `ras_location`, 
`time_stamp` == `ras_timestamp`, and `raw_data` == `raw_data`.

Currently only issues RESTful create requests. Planned improvements add local calls.
----
|=============================================================================

===== Sample Action

Using the above tools an action may be written that:
 1. Processes a field in the event, checking to see it's in a valid range.
    [source,ruby]
        unless %{xid}.between?(1, 81);

 2. Sets the message id to a default value if the field is not within range.
    [source,ruby]
        ras_msg_id="gpu.xid.unknown" end;

 3. Generate a ras message with the new id.
    [source,ruby]
        .send_ras;

All together it becomes:
[source,ruby]
    unless %{xid}.between?(1, 81); ras_msg_id="gpu.xid.unknown" end; .send_ras;

This action script is then compiled and stored by the plugin at load time then executed when
actions are triggered by events.

====  CSM Event Correlator Pipeline Configuration Options

This plugin supports the following configuration options:

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=============================================================================
| Setting | Input type | Required
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-events_dir>>          | <<string,string>>   | No
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-patterns_dir>>        | <<array,array>>     | No
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-named_captures_only>> | <<boolean,boolean>> | No
|============================================================================

Please refer to <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> for options supported in all Logstash
filter plugins.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-events_dir"]
===== `events_dir`
    * Value type is <<string,string>>
    * Default value is `/etc/logstash/conf.d/events.yml`

The configuration file for the event correlator, see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-event_config>> for
details on the contents of this file.

This file is loaded on pipeline creation.

NOTE: This field will use an <<array,array>> in future iterations to specify multiple configuration
files.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-patterns_dir"]
===== `patterns_dir`
    * Value type is <<array,array>>
    * Default value is `[]`

A directory, file or filepath with a glob. The listing of files will be parsed for grok patterns
which may be used in writing patterns for event correlation. If no glob is specified in the path
`*` is used.

Configuration with A file glob:

[source,ruby]
    
    patterns_dir => "/etc/logstash/patterns/*.conf" # Retrieves all .conf files in the directory.

Configuration with multiple files:

[source,ruby]
   
   patterns_dir => ["/etc/logstash/patterns/mellanox_grok.conf", "/etc/logstash/patterns/ibm_grok.conf"]

CSM Event Correlator will load the default Logstash patterns regardless of the contents of this
field.

Pattern files are plain text with the following format:

[source,ruby]
    
    NAME PATTERN

For example:

[source,ruby]

    GUID [0-9a-f]{16}

The patterns are loaded on pipeline creation.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-named_captures_only"]
===== `named_captures_only`
    * Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
    * Default value is `true`

If true only store captures that have been named for grok. `Anonymous` captures are considered 
named.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-event_config"]
====  CSM Event Correlator Event Configuration File

CSM Event Correlator uses a YAML file for configuration. The YAML configuration is
heirarchical with 3 major groupings:
 * <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-event_metadata,Metadata>>
   * <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-event_data_sources, Data Sources>>
     * <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-event_categories, Categories>>

This is a sample configuration of this file:

[source,YAML]

----
---
# Metadata
ras_create_url: "/csmi/V1.0/ras/event/create"
csm_target: "localhost"
csm_port: 4213

          action: ".send_ras;"
        - tag: "MMSYSMON_UNMOUNT_FORCED"
          pattern: "filesystem %{NOTSPACE:filesystem} was.*forced.*unmount"
          ras_msg_id: "spectrumscale.fs.unmount_forced"
          action: ".send_ras;" 
...

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-event_metadata"]
===== Event Metadata

The metadata section may be thought of as global configuration options that will apply to all events
in the event correlator. 

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=============================================================================
| Field | Input type | Required
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ras_create_url>> | string  | Yes <Initial Release>
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-csm_target>>     | string  | Yes <Initial Release>
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-csm_port>>       | integer | Yes <Initial Release>
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-data_sources>>   | map     | Yes
|============================================================================

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ras_create_url"]
====== `ras_create_url`
    * Value type is string
    * Sample value: `/csmi/V1.0/ras/event/create`

Specifies the REST create resource on the node runnning the CSM REST Daemon. This path will be
used by the `.send_ras;` utility.

NOTE: This will eventually have a default value of `/csmi/V1.0/ras/event/create`

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-csm_target"]
====== `csm_target`
    * Value type is string
    * Sample value: `127.0.0.1`

A server running the CSM REST daemon. This server will be used to generate ras events with the
`.send_ras;` utility.

NOTE: This will eventually have a default value of `127.0.0.1`

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-csm_port"]
====== `csm_port`
    * Value type is integer
    * Sample value: `4213`

The port on the server running the CSM REST daemon. This port will be used to connect by the 
`.send_ras;` utility.

NOTE: This will eventually have a default value of `4213`

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-data_sources"]
====== `data_sources`
    * Value type is map

A mapping of data sources to event correlation rules. The key of the `data_sources` field 
matches `type` field of the logstash event processed by the filter plugin. The type field
may be set in the `input` section of the logstash configuration file.

Below is an example of setting the type of all incoming communication on the `10515` tcp port to
have the _syslog_ `type`:
[source,ruby]
input {
    tcp {
        port => 10515
        type => "syslog"
    }
}

The YAML configuration file for the _syslog_ data source would then look something like this:
[source,YAML]
data_sources:
    syslog:
        # Event Data Sources configuration settings.
    # More data sources.

The YAML configuration uses this structure to reduce the pattern space for event matching. If the
user doesn't configure a type in this `data_sources` map CSM will discard events of that type for
consideration in event correlation.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-event_data_sources"]
===== Event Data Sources

Event data sources are entries in the <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-data_sources, data_sources>> map.
Each data source has a set of configuration options which allow the event correlator to parse
the structured data of the logstash event being checked for event corelation/action generation.

This section has the following configuration fields:
[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=============================================================================
| Field | Input type | Required
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ras_location>>  | string  | Yes <Initial release>
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ras_timestamp>> | string  | Yes <Initial release>
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-event_data>>    | string  | Yes
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-category_key>>  | string  | Yes
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-categories>>    | map     | Yes
|============================================================================

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ras_location"]
====== `ras_location`
    * Value type is string
    * Sample value: `syslogHostname`

Specifies a field in the logstash event received by the filter. The contents of this
field are then used to generate the ras event spawned with the `.send_ras;` utility. 

The referenced data is used in the `location_name` of the of the REST payload sent by `.send_ras;`.

For example, assume an event is being processed by the filter. This event has the field 
`syslogHostname` populated at some point in the pipeline's execution to have the value of _cn1_.
It is determined that this event was worth responding to and a RAS event is created. Since
`ras_location` was set to `syslogHostname` the value of _cn1_ is POSTed to the CSM REST daemon
when creating the RAS event.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ras_timestamp"]
====== `ras_timestamp`
    * Value type is string
    * Sample value: `timestamp`

Specifies a field in the logstash event received by the filter. The contents of this
field are then used to generate the ras event spawned with the `.send_ras;` utility. 

The referenced data is used in the `time_stamp` of the of the REST payload sent by `.send_ras;`.

For example, assume an event is being processed by the filter. This event has the field 
`timestamp` populated at some point in the pipeline's execution to have the value of 
_Wed Feb 28 13:51:19 EST 2018_. It is determined that this event was worth responding to 
and a RAS event is created. Since `ras_timestamp` was set to `timestamp` the value of 
_Wed Feb 28 13:51:19 EST 2018__ is POSTed to the CSM REST daemon when creating the RAS event.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-event_data"]
====== `event_data`
    * Value type is string
    * Sample value: `message`

Specifies a field in the logstash event received by the filter. The contents of this field
are matched against the specified patterns. 

IMPORTANT: This is the data checked for event correlation once the event list has been selected,
make sure the correct event field is specified.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-category_key"]
====== `category_key`
    * Value type is string
    * Sample value: `programName`

Specifies a field in the logstash event received by the filter. The contents of this field
are used to select the category in the `categories` map. 

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-categories"]
====== `categories`
    * Value type is map

A mapping of data sources categories to event correlation rules. The key of the `categories` field
matches field specified by `category_key`. In the included example this is the program name of a 
syslog event.

This mapping exists to reduce the number of pattern matches performed per event. Events that don't
have a match in the categories map are ignored when performing further pattern matches.

Each entry in this map is an array of event correlation rules with the schema described in 
<<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-event_categories,Event Categories>>. Please consult the sample for 
formatting examples for this section of the configuration.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-event_categories"]
===== Event Categories

Event categories are entries in the <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-categories, categories>> map.
Each category has a list of tagged configuration options which specify an event correlation rule.

This section has the following configuration fields:
[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=============================================================================
| Field | Input type | Required
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-tag>>          | string  | No
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-pattern>>      | string  | Yes <Initial Release>
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-action>>       | string  | Yes <Initial Release>
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ras_msg_id>>   | string  | No <Needed for RAS> 
|============================================================================

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-tag"]
====== `tag`
    * Value type is string
    * Sample Value: `XID_GENERIC`

A tag to identify the event correlation rule in the plugin. If not specified an internal identifier
will be specified by the plugin. Tags starting with `.` will be rejected at the load phase as 
this is a reserved pattern for internal tag generation.

NOTE: In the current release this mechanism is not fully implemented.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-pattern"]
====== `pattern`
    * Value type is string
    * Sample Value: `mlx5_core %{MLX5_PCI}.*module %{NUMBER:module}, Cable (?<cableEvent>(un)?plugged)`

A grok based pattern, follows the rules specified in <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-grok_primer,Grok Primer>>.
This pattern will save any pattern match extractions to the event travelling through the pipeline. 
Additionally, any extractions will be accessible to the `action` to drive behavior. 

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-action"]
====== `action`
    * Value type is string
    * Sample Value: `unless %{xid}.between?(1, 81); ras_msg_id="gpu.xid.unknown" end; .send_ras;`

A ruby script describing an action to take in response to an event. The `action` is taken when
an event is matched. The plugin will compile these scripts at load time, cancelling the startup
if invalid scripts are specified.

This script follows the rules specified in <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-action_programming,action programming>>. 

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ras_msg_id"]
====== `ras_msg_id`
    * Value type is string
    * Sample Value: `gpu.xid.%{xid}`

A string representing the ras message id in event creation. This string may specify fields in the 
event object through use of the `%{FIELD_NAME}` pattern. The plugin will attempt to populate
the string using this formatting before passing to the action processor.

For example, if the event has a field `xid` with value _42_ the pattern _gpu.xid.%{xid}_ will resolve
to _gpu.xid.42_.
